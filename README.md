# Merge Function with Unit Test

This repository contains a TypeScript project that implements a merge function and includes unit tests to ensure its correctness.

## Project Structure

- `merge.ts`: Contains the implementation of the `merge` function.
- `merge.test.ts`: Contains the unit tests for the `merge` function.

## Dependencies

The project has the following dev dependencies:

- `@types/jest`: Provides TypeScript type definitions for Jest.
- `ts-jest`: Allows Jest to work with TypeScript code.
- `ts-node`: Enables the execution of TypeScript files directly with Node.js.

## Getting Started

To set up the project and run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:noobm224/merge-with-unit-test.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd merge-with-unit-test`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the tests: `npm test`

Jest will execute the unit tests defined in `merge.test.ts` and display the results in the terminal.
